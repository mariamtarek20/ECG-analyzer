Project Overview:
Problem:
Sudden heart attack deaths have seen a significant increase in the last decade. In addition to genetic and lifestyle factors, the lack of medical resources in rural areas contributes to most heart attack fatalities in developing countries.

Objective:
Aligned with the EGYPT2030 vision of making healthcare more accessible, this project aims to develop a prototype for a low-cost, portable ECG-based cardiology screening device. The goal is to create a machine learning model that runs on low-cost embedded hardware, providing a solution for diagnosing various heart diseases.

Competition:
This project was submitted as part of the 5th Helwan Olympiad of AI in 2021 in Egypt .

Special Features:
IoT Medical Device:
The project introduces a portable ECG device that sends bulk data for analysis, making healthcare more accessible in resource-limited settings.
Competition Recognition:
This project was submitted as part of the 5th Helwan Olympiad of AI in 2021, showcasing its competitive nature and relevance in the field of artificial intelligence.
